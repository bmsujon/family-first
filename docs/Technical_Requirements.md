*   **Client-Side Application:** A Progressive Web App (PWA) built with React
*   **API Layer:** RESTful API and WebSocket services provided by Node.js
*   **Database Layer:** MongoDB for flexible document storage
*   **Authentication Service:** JWT-based authentication with OAuth support
*   **Storage Service:** For file uploads and document storage
*   **Notification Service:** For in-app, browser, and email notifications
*   **Background Processing:** For generating reports and handling scheduled tasks

### 2.2 Component Details
